# pixel_board
pixel-board is a infinite canvas/clipboard for dumping your memes and then reusing them, it is a new way of storing images which reduces the upload time and makes them very easy to find, you can just zoom out :D
## setup


```bash
git clone https://github.com/kussshhhh/pixel_board.git
cd pixel_board
npm install
npm run dev
```

deployed link: https://pixel-board-omega.vercel.app/
